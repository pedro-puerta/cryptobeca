# Cryptobeca - A Study and Research Project on Blockchain and Cryptography

Cryptobeca is an open-source project developed with the aim of providing a learning and research experience in blockchain and cryptography. Inspired by the name of my daughter, Rebeca, the project seeks to explore the fundamental concepts behind blockchain technologies and cryptographic security.

## Key Features

1. Simplified Blockchain Implementation: The project offers a simplified implementation of a blockchain, allowing users to understand how blocks are created and linked to form an immutable chain of blocks.

2. Secure Transactions: Transactions are protected with digital signatures using the secp256k1 elliptic curve, the same one used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

3. Proof-of-Work: To ensure the security of the blockchain, the project uses a proof-of-work mechanism, where miners must solve computational challenges to add a new block to the chain.

4. Digital Wallet: Users can generate cryptographic key pairs (private key and public key) and conduct transactions using a digital wallet.

5. Beginner-Friendly Development Environment: Cryptobeca has been developed with clarity and simplicity in mind, making it a conducive environment for students, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts.

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational and research purposes and should not be used for production purposes. Its aim is to provide a solid foundation for understanding the fundamental principles of blockchain and cryptography.

Feel free to explore the code, make contributions, and use it as a basis to deepen your knowledge in blockchain and cryptography. Join us on this journey of learning and discovery!

## Note

While the project's implementation is functional, it is important to note that it does not cover all aspects and complexities of a complete blockchain. The project should be used for educational purposes only and is not intended to be used as a production system for handling real assets.
